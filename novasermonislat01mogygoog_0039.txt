The first two verbs alone show distinct character of their own, which ls -

the radicat letter, a in the 1.‚ e in the ll., the lll. and the 1V. are more irregu-
lar; therefore the infinitive alone can be a safe guide.

The English Infinitive is exp'ressed by the particle to, as to live, to go, to
ειιιρς ln meaning both English and Latin Infinitives agree, but in Latin,
Infinitive is expressed by the endings re, in Active, ri, (i) in Passive. with
adding to these the radicat, or characteristic letter of each group, or conjuga·
tion, as above. We shall then have:

1. ll. 111. lV.
Act. ἁτε bre ere ire
Pass, ἀπ’ ἑνί i iri

Therefore: 1. vocare, habitare, natdre, &c.
ll. habere, movere, lucere, fulgere, διε.
lll. sdrgere, pergere, trahere, volvere, διε.
Ν. exire, διε.
l Passive:
1. Vocari, habitari, appellari, διε. ΙΙ., haberi, moveri, διε.
ΙΠ., verti, volvi, trahi, &a lV., exiri, oriri, &a

The difference between the ll. and ln. is, that the 11., ire, is ac'cented‚
and the ἓ is long ; the e in the 111. is unaccented and short, the accent testing
on the preceding vowel.

For the later changes in the verbs it is necessary that we know their other
important parts; these are: ’

tst. The first person of the ‘Prosent tense of the Indicataebe Mood, which is o ,

in all verbs, in Active Voice‚ excepting est, and or in the Passive.
. 2d. The first person of the perfect tense, in the same Mood, which is vi,
or ui, in all the regular verbs. ·
3d. Α form, which is called supinum3 this ls always tum, or sum, unless
wanting altogether.
