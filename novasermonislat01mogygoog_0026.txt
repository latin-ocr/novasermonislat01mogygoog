PALAESTRA

When do we use Genitive? There are at least a dozen rules and distinc-
tions governing thls question ς but the following rule will comprise all of
thern, hence, bear ln mind once for all: When two nouus occur ln a sentence
connected, one of them will always be in Genltive‚ the other may be ln any
case; as z pes and mensa, one of them clearly owns the other, therefore, pes
mensoe, mucro cultri, latus trianguli, or, in plum pedes mensarum, mucrones
cultrorum, latera triangulorum.

All the nouns we have heretofore heard naturally divide themselves into
the following five groupS, all depending on the Genitive.

3 GROUP Nom. slNG. GEN.81NG. ΝΟΜ. 121.. GEN. PL.
⁸ 1. ' a ιε oe arum
11. us, er, um i i, a orum

lll. arnt ending is es, a, ia um, ium
lV. us us us uum

V. - es ei es erum '

Hence follows that all noun& which have their Gen. in ιε, will belong to
the group ¹3 Gen. i, Nom. us, or cr. or um will all be of the 11; any noun
with Gen. is, no matter what the Nom. be, will belong to 111; nouns with us
Gen. pertain to 1v. ς Gen. ei. Nom. es, all go to V.

These grouos are called declinationes, or bendings away. ln grammar,
deciensions. We have, then, five declensions ς they are as follows:

EXAMPLES:
οεΝ. slNG.
i. linea, mola, rota, fabrica, rheda, ι oe
