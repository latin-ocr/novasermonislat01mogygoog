PENSUM SEXTUM

beniug moved ” will come nearer to the Latin. but the best rendering of it is
in active form ‘⁴ they move,” ‘⁴ he moves‚'' διε.

Butl may also say “l wash myself‚” ⁸⁸1 move myself.’' ln this case
both subiect and object are the same. This form may be called the reflexim,
or middle verb, which, ln English, is expressed partly as the above, partly by
simple Active Volce, as: the wheel moves, the planets move, without reference
to time3 otherwise, wlth the participle is, are, were, have, been mom'ng3 in
Latin we use the passive form: rota movetur, pianetae rotantur, or, equus sa
movet, sol sese movet.

The verb monife, is used ln this lesson ε -

rst, as an active transitive verbt aqua movet rotam ;

2d, as a passive verb : rota movetur ab aqua ;

3d, as a middle verb: pleneta non stat, sed movetur, and
also by circumlocution ε sol sese movet.

Both the Active and Passive Voices comprise certain frames, which we
call Moods, i. e., manners, modes ; for much depends on how we utter a
verb. There is certainly a great differente between saying‚ ‘⁶ 1 am sleepy ”
and “get out!” The former way of expresslng is called the ‘⁶ lndicative
Mood,'' the latter ‘⁸ imperative, ” or bidding mode. Resides these two there
are two more, the Infinitive and Subsiencttbe. These are mutilated names from
original Latin, Modus InfinituS, Modus Imperativus, Modus Indae‘catstm, and Mo·
dus Coninmctimcs. The two latter contain six tenses, i, e.‚ timeS, to wit: Now
time (present), half-done time (imperfect), done time; (perfect) more-than-
donetime (pluperfect), to come-time (future) and the shall-bavebeendone
(future perfect) time. ln Latin: Tempus Praesens, T.Praeteritum Imperfectum,
T. P. Perfectum, Τ.Ρ. Plus-quam-perrectum, T. Futurum Simplex, T. Futu- .
rum Exactum. Each tense has two numbers, singular and plural, and three
persons ln each, the rst, the 2nd, and the 3d: 1, thou, lu (she, it),we, you, they.

lt is the Infinitive Mood by which we classify the Latin verbS.

From what we know thus far, we may group the verbs in this manner:
