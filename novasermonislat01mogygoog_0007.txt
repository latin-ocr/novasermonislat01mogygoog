SONUS LlTTERARUM
1. VOCALlUM

As a language is buta chain of soumis, and letters are but signs of these
soundS, they must be uttered‚ especially in Latin, very clearly and distinctly.

A vowel, sometimes alone, sometimes with another vowel, more frequent·
ly with one or more consonantS, makes a syllable. A syllable, which ls
formed by two vowelS, is called a diphthong (diphthongus), as: aut, haud,
ceu, seu, &c., which in English spelling would sound: out, howd‚ keh-oo
(but contracted into one sound), seh-oo.

A vowel, consequently a syllable, is elther short or long. By this we
mean, that ‘lt takes shorter or longer time to pronounce it, but this does not
affect the sound of the letterS‚ as it does in English. Whether short or long,
a is a, e is e, ι· ls ι’, &c., we only stretch the same sound, as if adding one or
two additional vowels of the same kind, thus: a, short ; aa, long ς e, short,
ee, long. Examples for the τυπεὶς : papci (a, ά) ,· again (e, ὅ) ; quinine (keenim
i, 5); trombone (o, ὁ) ; full moon (u, ἃ). For y and unaccented u we have no
examples ln English, the student must be referred to French and German.
Latin sylva, ςγιιαόα, Sylla, Sibylla, hyemS, and lubet, quaesumuS, optumus
(in old spelling), and all other words of this kind, are pronounced so far as
they and the marked u·s are concerned‚ with French u, or German u.

There are two compounded vowels ln Latin ω and ω, their soundis
simple e.
