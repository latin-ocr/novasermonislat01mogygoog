PENSUM SEPTIMUM

will also be there, following the noun, seldom going before it, excepting

when the adj. is more important than the noun itself. This is the natural .

order, since the thing is more im ortant than its ualities. lt is the noun that
bears the gender, the case and t e member. ln nglish we say: the large
wheel, the hig horse; in Latin : rota magna, e uus magnus3 yet there are in·
stances of similar construction in English, ike: times inimemorial, bod
politic, διε. The stress lies always on the ad'ective. An adj. will prec e⁴
a noun, when the quality is in question, nott e thing; as: Qui equus est
in stabulo? Parvus equus est ibi! ln most cases, however, the emphasis
alone answers the question, and the natural order is followed.

While adjectives follow their nouns and agree with themingender‚nurn·
ber and case, they do not follow them in dectension. There are five declen·
sions for the nouns, but adjectives can only belong to the first three,· none
belongs to the lV. and V. The noun may belon to the V„ the adj. to the
111., as: dies (V) brevis (ΙΙΙ), or nox (ΙΙΙ) opaca (ᾗ, domus (lv.) pqrva (l);

Thereare a few more van’etleS, which we shall see in due time.

The easiest way to know an adjective apart frorn a noun or a verb is to-
eompare them thus: long, longer, longest. We cannot say: a body, a bodier,
a bodiest, nor,.walk, walker, walkest : the former being a noun, the latter a
verb. When we are satisfied that the word is an adJective, like large, in its
first· form, it is said to be ln the positive degree ς larger is thought to be on a
higher degree (or step), and is called comparative degree 3 largest is the third,
the highest or superlative degree. ·

Latin adjectives are compared this way ε

As to· their declension: the us, a, um, both in the positive and in the

latim, follow the rule, i.·e., 11.‚ 1.‚ 11.; in the com arative, of course, tssey
must follow the third, since, owing to the ior en ing, they cannot belong
to either the 1. or the 11. Hence we thus decline them ε
