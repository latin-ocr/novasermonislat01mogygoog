The names of the months are adjectives, but they are used, tor the most
part, as nouns. -

Serial things are expressed by the ordinal numerals. Such serials are the
hours (the minutes and seconds are not), days and years. When we say

“ in English, ⁸ lt is three o’clock‚' we mean that itis three strokes of the clociz,

or bell, indicating the third hour. Likevise, speaking of years we mean the
eighteen·hundred·and·ninety-sixth year, though we say ‘⁴ ninety-six.'' The
days we say properly: the first of Janu'ary, the fifth of August. ln Latin this
principle is very strictly enforced. Consequently we say: Primus Ianuarii,
millesimi octingentesimi nonagesimi& sexti ; i. e., all are ordinals. But
if that number of years'is meant, just like in English, we would use the
cardinals.

According to the above we ask: Quota hora est? Answer: Est tertia.
Quando surgit sol? AEstate surgit quarta curn dimidio, hyeme autem post
sextam vel etiam septimam.

When a numeral signifies a date, that is, a minute, an hour, a day, a
year, on, at, or in which a thing takes place, will be Joined with Ablativez
this is called the Ablative os time. ln the sentence, Sol surgit hora sexta
matutina, the three last words are in Ablative. The same way, die-noctuque,
hodie, horno (this year), aestate, vere, hyeme &c., are Ablatives.-There-
fore, if we wish to say, In summer, in winter, at five o’clock, οη Friday, last
year, next year, δια, these words are simply put into Abi. (sing„ or pl.)
without any prepositiom thus: Hyeme, aestate, hora quinta, dic Veneris, anno
superiore (or, eiaps0)‚ anno futuro, mense proximo (next), &c.; expl.; Hoc
vespere laborem finivimus hora quinte curn quadrante, hodie plus non
laborabimus3 sed cras mature surgemu5,'atque decern minutis ante septimam
laborem incipiemuS, laborabimus quinas horas, tum, meridia, quietem
, capiemus (we shall take), dein laborabimus totum postmeridiem, hora vero

quinta cum tribus quadrantibus laborare cessabimus, atque hora nona ·

vespertina cubitum pergemus·
³ Sex horas laborare, To work six hours; Septem horas dormite, To sleep seven ,
hourS. The duration of time, like in English, is expressed by Accusatiu
when a thing happens, as stated above, otherwise by Abl.without preposition.

Cubitum perginms. When two verbs occur in a sentence depending on
each other, as: he goes to sleep, one of them will always be in Infinitive (to
sleep); ex.z laborare cessamuS, we cease to work. But, if the verb, upon
