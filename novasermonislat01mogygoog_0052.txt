PALAESTRA

tietb, are the places these numerals, or what they quality, hold ln a row,
-countlng from the first. Domus decem, ten houses ; domus decena, is but one

house, but the tenth ln a row.

All of these numerals are adjectives. The Ordinals are regular us, a, um
klnd and are declined as such. Among the Cardinals the first three. mys,
a, um, duo, dua, duo and tres, tria take endingS, the rest are undeclinable.

When any numeral stands fora noun, i. e.. when it has no noun to follow
ln gendegi it ls neuter, as ln counting z unum, duo, tria, primum, secundum,
ternum, c.

Unum is also used ln plural with plural nouus, as una castra, a single
camp3 uni Romani, the Romans alone. lt is declined thus:

Nom. unus, a, um,

Gen. unius,

Dat. uni,

Acc. unum, am, um,
Abl. uno, a, ο

Instead of tridecim, sidecim, septimdccim, octodecim and novemdecim, ln
literary and classical Latin decem ὃ· tria, decem ἃ· sex, decem ἃ· septem, or,
decem octo, decem novem are used most frequently, popularly however the

former contractioris are mostly used.

Eight and nine, in each decade, excepting 68, 69, and 98, are also thus
expressed: duodevngmti (two from twenty)=18, undeviginti, 19, duodetrigi uta,
28, undequadraginta, 39, διε.

ln the Ordinals the same rules prevail‚ only, we say more frequently
tertae'um decimum , quqrtum decae‘rnum, than decimum ξφ tertt'um, &c.

The Cardinals have no plurals, but nounS, or adjectiveS, which they
qualify, must follow in plural, as : quatuor fenestra, centum casae. Centum
has no plural excepting when compounded with other numerals, as: ducen-
tum, when it loses its singular, and is declined like any other adiective:
ducenti, ae, εις -orurn, arum, orum, &c., so all the rest until mille.

Mille is a neuter noun, therefore, wheneverit is to qualifya noun, this noun
will stand in Genitive, as: mille pedum. But it can also be used asan
adjective, when its plural form is mille (noun form in pl. is millia),

as mille equi.
