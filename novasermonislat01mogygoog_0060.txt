PENSUM NONUM

As lt will beseen, the 1. and 11. receive abi and eln' syllables», while the 111.
and lv. onlyeand ierespectively. ΑΙΙ verbs, unless irregular, follow this
rule, as: stabimuS, movebimuS, trahemus, promimus, &c. The passive
form is just as simple, only changing final s into r, thus: trahemur..
movebimur.

Ficimus, descripsimus, obtimiimus. These verbs are ln the past tense ²-
Fecimus is from facto ,· it is very irregular, and in the fut. it isfacicmus, in.
the past fecimus, The past forms ot the tour groups are:

The syllable which changes a verb into pastis vi (ui, psl, xi, &c.,
according to the nature of the verb), which, like all others, is attached to
the stem, thus: natavimus habaimuS, traximus. -

Dividens, subtracta, dtbt‘dmdi. The first of these ls the present particzple, the-
second is the perfect partoeaeple, and the third is the future passive participle.

· ι. Bear in mind that the present participle (English—ing) always means.
the doer, the person or thing which acts, while the Englsh signifies partly
the action itself, partly the thing done. Ex. writing, means the action, or.
the thing written ς in Latin ς scribens, means the doer. The endings are-c

They all belong to the ill. declenslon.

2. The perfect participle exactly coincides with the English -ιᾰ, ln lovcd„

and, as such, they are declined like parvus, magnus.
