1, ι’, e„ my person, who does the washing3 znd, the action, or doing, and 3d.
the thingl wash. l am the εἰσιν. that is, the subject of the verb3 the thing l
wash is the object ot the verb, · the action, washing, is the verb itself. Let
the sentence be. 1 wash my handu 1 is the subject of the sentence, hands· is the
obiect, wash is the prcdzcatc ln an ordinary Latin sentence this order of the
parts of sentence should be always kept for a rule.

The verb in the above sentence is active, i. e., doing, because the subiect
(1) is the doer, 1 arn washing, not another, and my doing acts upon what l
wash (the object, my hands). But thou mayest wash thy hands,'' and also
‘⁶ he (she, lt) may wash his ther, its) handS.'' ‘⁶ 1 ” is the first person.
‘⁸ thou'' is the second person, ‘⁸ he, ’² ⁸⁸ she, '' or ⁸⁸ it‚’' is the third person.

Properly speaking there is no Passive Voice in English corresponding to
Latin. The English passive is periphrastic, i.e., circumlocutory, that iS, com·
pounded from the perf. participle and an auxiliary, or helping verb, therefore
it only answers similar periphrastic forms in Latin. When we say ⁸⁸ the
wagon is movcd '’ it is nothing rnore than Latin ‘⁸ currus est rnotus,'' while
