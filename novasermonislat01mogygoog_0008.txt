PALAESTRA

We do not mark the quantity (shortness, longness) of the syllableS, because t

rst, it has absolutely no bearing upon speech and upon prose.

2nd‚ its sole domain isin poetry (prosody).

3rd, it cannot be forced under cast iron ruleS.

4th, much of it is controverted, and not agreed upon by the Romans .
themselves, ’

stin, since it is unsettled, it becomes the source of useless vexation, pedan-
try, an unjustifrable drudge for teachers and students alike, not to speak of
the unseemly appearance it gives to our school-books

ll. CONSONAT1UM

Latin consonants are sounded like English, except the following:

C is always k3 G is always hard, as ln get; H is not quite so strong as
in English ς ] is not a Latin letter, therefore not to be used3 l< only occurs
in a very few words; R must be pronounced forcibly, rolling it with the tip
of the tongue‚ like the second r in the English word arrears. . S never
changes into q. T, “dry,’' as in hit. V, like in English v, and it also
stands for u, this latter being a modification of v. X, iks, is always ks,
never gf.

Ch, ka·hah‚ corresponds to German ch.

- ΡΙι, pa·hah, and rh, err-hah, like English.

Th, ta-hah, like t, and Ιι separately, nearly like in “met him”.

Of these l, m, n, r, are called liquids, h aspirant, s sibilant, all the others
mutes. X is a double consonant.

ACCENTUS

This word means something like be-singing a word, as all speech is more
021555ῖᾶςίἰὲῗῶ rule‚ the streSS‚ or accent, in Latin lies on the syllable
before the last, as in English piano. A vowel before another being short, like
in nouns ending in io, the accent shifts to the next backward, as: na’tio.

ἢ Whenever such change occurS, we shall mark the accented vowel, as: hri·

milis· ln long words there may be two accentS, as: reconciliationibus.
-Accent is usually on a long vowel, but not always. ln quaesivimus, ac·
centis on long ἱ, didimus, patina. it rests on a short vowel. ‚Nearly
every new syllable attached to aword shifts the accent forward or back·
ward, as: hamiliS, humilitaS, humilitdte, humilitatique. The two unaccen-
syllables (endings) que and ne draw the accent upon the next preceding
syllable, as3 honzinz'cmque‚ habitum but ,their are exceptions. We shall
endeavor to mark the accent on each new word and on new endings‚ until
they become familiar. Hearing and practice will be the best teache‘rS.
