GRAMMATch.

Α new rcase is Casus Amathus, the taking away case, or Ablatlve. As its
name indicates, this case means rnovlng away, opposite to a roaching.
Α word, standing in this case, by itself‚ without any preposssfon, offers
meanings like off, away, wrth, by, at, in English.

Ablative, then ls used, rst with prepositions like ira, a, (ab), e, de. znd,
independently, that is, without prepositions. 'fhe seming difficulty, then, is
to know when ‘to use the one, when the other. We shall learn this as we go
along. Now, some verbs will readily suggest both, preposition and case,
like ascendit, descendit. The former isa contractiori of ad-scendlt3 then, if

we know that ad means to, ι’, e. approaching, we rnay guess at Ace. and
say: ascendit coelum, ascendit turrem, or, ascendit ad caminum. But ir other

direction is meant, another prepos.‚ must be used, as z ascendit in coelo. Dn
however will always govern an Abi„ descendit de coelo.

The first sitim rule for an Abl. without a repos. is furnished by the sen·
tences ‘⁸ So surglt hora sexta matutina,” “ ora duodecima est meridies, ”
hora sexta, etc.. here are Ablatlves without a prepos.; and they are called
the Abl. os Τ ime, or more properly the Ablative os date. So we say tempon
diurno, t. nocuum, die, nocta, interdiu, noctu, dio-noctuque.

The regular Abi. of din and nox are dis, nocte, but when the idea of night
time, day tirne, day-and·nlght are to be expressed, we say as above.

Primum. secundum, decimum, etc„ differ from unm, duo, tn’a, decem, ete..

just the same way as the English· first, second, tenth, etc.. differ
from one, two, three, ten etc.; the first are called ordina! Numerals, the

. second Gardthat (hingelNumeq-ats. When we say “six o’clock‚” we do
not mean six hours, ut the mla hour from midni ht or noon. As Latin

is very precise, it r uires that we say no more, no ess, but what we mean.
Accordingly we say ora sexta, sixth hour, rzth hour, etc. But this is in
Nom. Should we speak of an event as taking or having taken place at a
certain time (honr, day, week‚ mouth, year), «Αϋι. ls used, as: sol media

nocte non lucet.

Other relations are ressed by repositions; as: sol nunquam est in
Septemtrlone, orimr in riente, oc dit in Occldente‚ stat autern hora duo-

gecima meridiana in meridie. Quando (when P) est sol in horizonte? Quando
