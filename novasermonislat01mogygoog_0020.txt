PALAESTRA

This casus is called the Casus accusativus, or charging, accusing case,
Accusative. ln what do they differ? How are they used? Their names fair·
iy explain it. The naming case simply names a thing: candela, baculus, quad·
ratum baculus est longus, quadratum non est rotundum. The charging case
has two principal applications: rst, when a certain class of prepositions‚
like super, asra, exter, aazia, etc. occur in a sentence, the noun, adJective,
pronoun‚ to which they refer, will stand in the charging, Accusative, case.
Then: tiata mensam3 sella est inter duas fenestras et unam ianuam. So in
English ει he is between me and Ιιης we shall not say, he is between 1 and
,ςΙιις Iu is nominative, me and her accusative. znd z after every verb wbtbh is
transitive, Le. which admits an object. Example: 1 stup, will not take an ob-
ject, as 1 cannot ask “ What do 1 sieep? ” and answer “ Ι sieep the bed ”.
Buti can say: he (Nonum, subject) charges me. Whom charges herm! He
accuses a man. eme, and man, are the objects of the transitive verbs to charge.

to accuse ς hence the name Accusame, for 'me and man are in the accusative
case. “

Such transitive verbs arefacit, sing.. faciunt, plur. ς habet, sing„ habent,
plur. Whenever they occur, the nouus, adjectives and pronouns‚ to which
they refer, will always stand ln Accusative‚ whether in sing. or ln plum
thus: casa habet unum caminum humilem, duas fenestras angustas, tectum hn-
mile atque unam ianuam parvam. Triangulum super quadratum saca domum.
